# CS296N-W25-RosaMyers
An educational repository for class projects for CS296N - Web Development II at Lane Community College

This is an ASP.NET website about the epic fantasy novels by J.R.R. Tolkien.
Each lab for the course sequence CS295N-CS296N (Web Development) added new functionality as I learn new topics.
I have set the repository to public so that my lab partners and instructors in the courses can access the project for the purposes of code reviews and grading.
